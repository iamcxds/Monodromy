# Monodromy
It is a demo for the idea that building a surface by tilemap. With this framework, many kinds of games can be made with innovation, like Sokoban.

You can play it here https://poincare.itch.io/monodromy, and also at https://iamcxds.github.io/Monodromy/

Now there are only two levels and three demo scenes available. For the levels you can try to solve the puzzles; for demo scenes, you can just walk around with WASD or arrow buttons, press Esc to get back to the menu. The maps here are Riemann surface, like the elliptic curve in the complex field.  

You can try to push the crates at demo scenes and obverse what will happen.

if you feel confused about the game space, you can watch [this video of another non-Euclidean 3D engine ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8&t=42s) to get help to understand what it is.

I write the game by elm, an interesting functional language for web apps.

Some of the image resources used come from  https://github.com/Orasund/pixelengine/tree/master/examples/Snake, they may be changed later. Now I change the character to a frog.
