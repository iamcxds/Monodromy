# Monodromy
It is a demo for the idea that buliding a surface by tilemap. With this frame work, many kinds of game can be made with new innovation, like sokoban.

You can play it here https://poincare.itch.io/monodromy , and also at https://iamcxds.github.io/Monodromy/

Now there is only there scene available, you can select at menu and just walk around with WASD or arrow buttons, press Esc to get back to menu. The maps here are Riemann surface, like elliptic curve in complex field.  The third map has ground with 4 colors, you can try to find them all. 

if you feel confused about the game space, you can watch [this video of another non-Euclidean 3D engine ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8&t=42s) to get help to understand what it is.

I write the game by elm, an interesting functional language for webapp.

The image resources used come from  https://github.com/Orasund/pixelengine/tree/master/examples/Snake , they may be changed later. Now I change the character to a frog.
