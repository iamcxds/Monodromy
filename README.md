# Monodromy
It is a demo for the idea that buliding a surface by tilemap. With this frame work, many kinds of game can be made with new innovation, like sokoban.

You can play it here https://poincare.itch.io/monodromy , also at https://iamcxds.github.io/Monodromy/

Now there is only one scene available, you can just walk around with WASD or arrow buttons. The map here is a elliptic curve in complex field. if you feel confused about the game space, you can watch [this video of another non-Euclidean 3D engine ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8&t=42s) to get understand what it is.

I write the game by elm, an interesting functional language for webapp.
