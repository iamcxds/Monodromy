# Monodromy
It is a demo for the idea that buliding a surface by tilemap. With this frame work, many kinds of game can be made with new innovation, like sokoban.

Now there is only one scene available, you can just walk around with WASD or arrow buttons. The map here is a elliptic curve in complex field.

I write the game by elm, an interesting functional language for webapp.
